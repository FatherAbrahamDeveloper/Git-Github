## Bug Fix

We encountered a critical bug in the project where the name and email fields were incorrectly set to placeholders. To fix this bug, we followed these steps:

1. Located the `mine.py` file in the codebase.
2. Opened the file and found the lines where `name` and `email` were set to "PUT YOUR NAME" and "PUT YOUR EMAIL."
3. Replaced the placeholders with the correct full name and email address.
4. Committed the changes to a new branch named "use-your-full-name."
5. Merged the "use-your-full-name" branch into the "main" branch.

The bug has been successfully resolved, and the application now displays the correct name and email.
